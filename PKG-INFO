Project Information
-------------------

OZI,
is a packaging management plane for Python packages
built with Meson_. This allows you to create a versioned and traceable
system of development practices.

Purpose
^^^^^^^

* What OZI is:

  * Checkpointed Python packaging for Meson projects focused on Python sources.

* What OZI is **not**:

  * A replacement for test environment managers like tox_, as a matter of fact OZI uses ``tox``.
  * A replacement for git hook package management tools like pre-commit_

OZI is meant for Python developers as a standardized and flexible but opinionated
Python packaging style guide and checkpointing API using the Meson build system.

The following checkpointed environments:

* code testing and coverage
* distributing Python packages with Meson_
* documentation linting, build, and doctests
* code linting and formatting

Message from the Maintainer
###########################

I just wanted packaging to work without having to reorient myself to best practices every time. 
This is a solution to help me package Python modules with Meson.
OZI can also help to synchronize packaging practices across packages using it, helping to reduce maintenance time.

Limitations
^^^^^^^^^^^

Due to reliance on features introduced in
`Meson version 1.1.0 <https://mesonbuild.com/Release-notes-for-1-1-0.html>`_
that is our minimum supported version, we do not currently plan support for prior releases.
