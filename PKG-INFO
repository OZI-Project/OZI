Project Information
-------------------

OZI,
is a packaging management plane for Python packages
built with Meson_. OZI helps create a version controlled
system of packaging practices.

See the `documentation <https://docs.oziproject.dev/>`_ for the project roadmap,
API specification, and Meson version support information.

Purpose
^^^^^^^

* What OZI is:

  * Checkpointed Python packaging for Meson projects focused on Python sources.

* What OZI is **not**:

  * A replacement for test environment managers like tox_, as a matter of fact OZI uses ``tox``.
  * A replacement for git hook package management tools like pre-commit_

OZI is meant for Python developers as a standardized and flexible but opinionated
Python packaging style guide and checkpointing API using the Meson build system.

The following checkpointed environments:

* code testing and coverage
* distributing Python packages with Meson_
* code linting and formatting
* documentation linting, build, and doctests 🚧 Work in Progress 🚧

Message from the Maintainer
###########################

I just wanted packaging to work without having to reorient myself to best practices every time. 
This is a solution to help me package Python modules with Meson.
OZI can also help to synchronize packaging practices across packages using it, helping to reduce maintenance time.
